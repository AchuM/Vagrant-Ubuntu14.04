  # config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]

  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
